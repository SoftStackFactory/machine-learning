A dictionary has a `key`, and each key maps to a `unique value`. A dictionary is useful when you are trying locate a specific value based on a key in a collection, opposed to iterating over an array/list to get to find specific value. Picture that you have to cycle through a really long list of items just to find the one you were looking for. Is cycling through all those items really necessary? Technically speaking cycling through a list takes longer time and more computer performance, something we need to be mindful of when working with machine learning with big data.
